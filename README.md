# My gulpfile.js

Hello you who wander by here! Please find a gulpfile that I wrote in order to use the following technologies:

* [bower](http://bower.io/), a front-end dependency manager
* [browser-sync](http://www.browsersync.io/), a live-reload tool for browsers
* [compass](http://compass-style.org/), a css framework based on [sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* and [ECMAScript 6](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/ECMAScript_6_support_in_Mozilla), the next version of JavaScript

This gulpfile is provided with tasks and according folders. Some are still uncomplete (`build` task is not far from scratch till now) and most of them may be rewritten sooner or later.

All tasks are self-explanatory ; however, if you need more informations to understand how they work, please refer to the following websites or repositories and their documentations:

* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/)
* [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)
* [gulp-babel](https://github.com/babel/gulp-babel)
* [main-bower-files](https://github.com/ck86/main-bower-files)
* [gulp-compass](https://github.com/appleboy/gulp-compass)
* [gulp-inject](https://github.com/klei/gulp-inject)
* [gulp-minify-css](https://github.com/jonathanepollack/gulp-minify-css)
* [gulp-plumber](https://github.com/floatdrop/gulp-plumber)
* [gulp-rename](https://github.com/hparra/gulp-rename)
* [gulp-sourcemaps](https://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps)
* [gulp-uglify](https://github.com/terinjokes/gulp-uglify)
* [gulp-watch](https://github.com/floatdrop/gulp-watch)
* [chalk](https://github.com/sindresorhus/chalk)
* [browserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/docs/gulp/)

Future improvements may be focused on Test Driven Development (with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/edge/introduction.html)), on a complete build task, and on some git integration. If you have some advices or remarks, I will be happy to listen to them.
